A project which allows a user to draw on the web page with their mouse cursor through javascript event listeners and dispatching. 
Although this project has the required functionality of The Odin Project assignment, it has some bugs from my attempt at implementing more features, such as toggling the drawing user's mouse cursor inputs from black and white to random colors, or allowing the user to toggle whether they can draw on previously drawn elements or not. It's too much of a headache to fix, and I feel like I learned a lot trying to implement the features in the first place.
